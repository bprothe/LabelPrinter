-----------------------------------------------
This Barcode Labeling Software has been written and designed by Brandon Prothe.
-----------------------------------------------
The intention of this program is to make it easier for people to print barcodes onto Zebra Label Printers.
This is free to use and not to be sold. This program has four primary functions.
To create LPK labels (4X6) to store pallets.
To create UPC labels (4X1) to put on merchandise.
To create custom labels (4X6 & 4X1) for use in whatever needed.
To create a list of labels/barcodes imported from a CSV.
-----------------------------------------------
------------GENERAL----------------------------

This program must be installed in a directory the current user has read/write/delete privlages for.
The installer will put root files in %userprofile%\appdata\local\labelprinter.
The config file in the app folder is only used for the LPK functionality.
On startup, this program will request the user to choose a printer. 
If a different printer is needed, the program must be closed and reopened.
The .pj file is the print job file. This is actually just a .png in disguise.
For 4X1 Labels(excluding UPC), the max character length is 30.
For 4X6 Labels(excluding LPK), the max character length is 25

------------UPC--------------------------------
UPC Print is used for printing Barcodes for products.
Desgined to print a small Barcode in a 4X1 format with UPC labeling underneath.
Double Sided functionality can print 2 barcodes on 1 label.

------------LPK Print--------------------------
LPK numbers are stored locally so this functionality only works with 1 computer/profile to print all LPKs.
The config file in the app folder is only used for the LPK functionality.
The most recent LPK printed will override what is on the config file.
If what is stored in the config file is wrong, either change it in the %userprofile%\appdata\local\labelprinter\app folder,
or you can send a print job with the correct number to also overwrite it.

------------Custom Print-----------------------
Custom Print is used to print specific barcodes with a certain amount.
This supports plain text and numbers. 
Custom print has a character limit of 12.

------------Import CSV-------------------------
Import CSV Print is used to print barcodes from a CSV format.
CSV download will put a PrintTemplate.csv on the current user's Downloads folder.
This is the format to use when importing CSV's.
Prefix, Label, and Suffix collumns are treated the same by the program and are combined as is.
